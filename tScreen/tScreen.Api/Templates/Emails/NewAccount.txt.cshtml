Hello @Model.Fullname,

Hello,

Welcome to the futuresTHRIVE Tween Screen™. We are dedicated to creating the tools that identify and track pediatric
mental health early and often. Together we will be making a difference in children’s lives today. We hope you find that
using our technology is easy and engaging.

Decades of research show that prevention and early intervention begin with monitoring before there are clear signs and
symptoms. Take, for example, height, weight, hearing and vision screening. We subscribe to these types of monitoring
because of the opportunity we have to intervene if we catch issues early and the consequences if we do not

futuresTHRIVE™ has taken the most recent and most advanced science and created one HIPAA compliant survey that
incorporates as many of the scientifically known risk and protective factors of childhood as we could, all in 12
minutes. The results will include evidence-based scales and individual patient generated information.
It is also visually fun! Where did we get the science? We used the latest research from the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American Academy of Psychiatry, JAMA, the CDC and WHO. Our team is made up of doctors and
stakeholders across the industry who are dedicated to changing the consequences of undiagnosed mental health concerns.

The futuresTHRIVE Tween Screen™ is best used for ages 9-14. It can be used with children as old as 18 but does not
include risky behavior questions. The survey is non-diagnostic, however the questions are aligned with the DSM® and
the American Academy of Pediatrics Common Factors®.
